Networking encompasses a wide variety of topics which can become quite advanced.
So, I'm going to start by introducing you to more casual concepts to begin with.
I'll assume you have little to no prior knowledge on these topics.

Expect to be introduced to a slew of abbreviations, foreign terminology and other good stuff, but don't let that bring you down!
If something piques your interest or you need further clarification, the web is your friend.

# An overview

Nowadays most technology is networked.
From your computer, to your phone, your car, and in some cases the toaster.
Something is "networked" when we have connected it to, you guessed it, a network.
In this case, a computer network.
The word itself is very generalised but I'll use it here to describe computer networks.

this is not near finished yet lol
