        <h2>Hi, I'm Ragge!</h2>
        <p>
            I work in the audiovisual industry, as a programmer for control systems.
            Welcome!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in mostly geeky topics like Linux systems, some coding, reading, mythology and whatnot.
            This webpage should serve as a mild introduction to who I am but if you'd like, you can find me here:

        <p>
            My website is pretty empty at the moment but I might start writing a logbook of sorts.
            My aim is to keep the HTML to a minimum, preferably keeping the same head everywhere so I only need to modify the actual page content.
            This means I'll have no sections across multiple pages, like a footer or a header.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've tried running with Jekyll, Svelte, and other frameworks, but it just doesn't sit right with me.
            I want to write text, not think about structuring the template around which I write my text.
            That's why Gopher and Gemini caught my interest.
            Maybe I'll move there in the future; their plaintext nature sounds nice, while still allowing me to share it in a recognisable medium.
        </p>
