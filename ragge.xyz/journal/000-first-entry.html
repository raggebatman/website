            This is my first entry, fun!
            Up until this point, I've only had thoughts of congregating my ideas and what I do.
            I guess this is it.
            More or less inspired by Dave Gauer at <a href="http://ratfactor.com">ratfactor.com</a> ^^

            I recently (as of writing this) read about his <a href="https://ratfactor.com/notes">notebook system</a> and I really love it.
            Now I'm thinking about doing something similar, maybe I'll have an update about that on here later.

            So anyway, a year or two ago I've not had a whole lot going on.
            Graduated from "Gymnasium" in the summer of 2022 (writing this on December that same year!) and got a job, surprisingly quick.
            I'm nineteen at the moment so I've not had any higher education, however, I have taken a couple courses at the HQ of the largest AV distributor in Sweden.
            That was during my internship, and in that period I got in touch with the people I currently work for.
            It meant I had to move to get the job but I'm really satisfied with it.

            I've had a long-standing appreciation for technology and I'm deeply interested in some aspects of it.
            I couldn't have been more than 14 years old when I wrote my first HTML, and since then it has just spiralled out of (into?) control.
            Just before I got into Gymnasium, my father handed me a server that was going to be put out of use at their workplace.
            That was my first introduction to hands-on Linux, really.
            I plugged the power cords in, and whipped out a keyboard and a mouse.
            I remember my father questioning me about the mouse, I wonder if he knew how little I knew at the time lol.

            If I'm to write a little about my online presence, I got my own e-mail address at 13 y/o and at that point I already had my own computer.
            My parents didn't let me get a smartphone until I was 15~16, which is understandable.
            The first phone I had was one of those "slide-up" phones but you slid it holding it vertically so that it exposed the keypad.
            Nowadays I think about going back to one of those feature phones, something solely for calling people.

            Sorry for jumping between topics like this but I'm just dumping what I have to say :)
            I usually spend my time on Discord at the moment, but I feel like that's gradually shifting.
            Before Discord (which I jumped on in 2016), there was a (now defunct) app much like Discord developed by Curse, later bought up by Twitch.
            I can't remember the name of the application but I met my longest standing online contact there.
            Quite probably one of the first 10 people I interacted with online, and I still see them around to this day.
            It won't be long before that'll have been a decade away...

            This person was the one who introduced me to programming.
            I don't think I would be where I am today if it weren't for them.
            So, if you're reading this, thank you :p
            My programming journey started as I mentioned with HTML, which naturally led onto JavaScript to interact with the DOM.
            As we moved onto Discord after Twitch bought up the previous platform, I got into a little bit of coding Discord bots.
            Those early days when the API didn't feel as restrictive as it does nowadays, and when Discord was all about gaming.

            My coding expertise hasn't evolved much outside of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and PHP for some reason (and, if I may include, SQL).
            I don't know what the thing is with PHP but I just find it very neat.
            Gradually, I'm making my way into lower-level languages.
            I've had a look at Rust (because of course why wouldn't I have) and a little more of C# which is going to be used at work.
            Java is also something I've been interested in solely because of Minecraft which is a game I've liked for a long time.

            YouTube as always has been a big content flood which sort of brought me into Linux.
            Nowadays I don't watch Linux content like that, but it's only natural that a kid like me would've been drawn into such content.
            My first time installing Linux outside of server hardware was Arch Linux dual-booted on my school laptop (not risky at all!)
            Thankfully, somehow, nothing got corrupted or deleted and my school didn't have a clue about any of it.
            I still have that laptop with me, running without xorg or wayland, just pure tty with stuff like tmux and vim installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of, I've recently started to delve into the Linux terminal more hardcore than before.
            My laptop is a great testing environment; I'd like to configure just about everything.
            Vim and tmux is something I never would've thought of using otherwise.
            Uh oh this is starting to get pretty long isn't it?
            I need to get to work now haha
