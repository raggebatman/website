                It's a new year!
                Wanted to say I bought two books for taking notes yesterday.
                A smaller lined one, and an A5 with graph dotted paper.
                Got two gel pens as well, one which you can rub away.
                Also added a new page to this website, a list of <a href="../cool-things">cool things</a>.

            <p>
                This is starting to look more and more like a "now" page...
                Well, what I call it doesn't really matter.
                It's nice to have a place where I can just write whatever I like, however it's formatted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyhoo, currently I'm learning NetLinx programming.
                I'd like to learn how to create a proper PHP backend as well, there's a lot to consider.
                Tomorrow I will look into getting a notebook or two so I can start with that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning NetLinx (by AMX) will be interesting.
                I already have working experience with a couple others, namely Crestron, QSC and Kramer on the control system side.
                Then, of course, every DSP manufacturer wants to have their own software.
                AMX isn't very large in Sweden, the situation here is far from what I've been told about the U.S.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh by the way, I would just like to go on about my Linux install on a laptop I've kept since school.
                It's running Arch Linux (as you do) and I would really like to get better at working without the mouse.
                I've spent some weeks running it solely on a terminal multiplexor (tmux) but really;
                As fun as it is to work around not using a GUI, at some point, a graphical environment is just necessary.
                So I settled on ratpoison.
                It has bindings like tmux and a similar workflow.

                Writing this on my way home on the train.
                Just thought I'd say that my website was added to the Geekring today (no. 236!)
                It's pretty neat so go have a look:

                It's Christmas Eve so I just felt like writing something a little short.
                Yeah, we celebrate on the eve in Sweden.
                Writing this at my parents' house which is where I used to live a mere couple months ago.
                Happy holidays, reader.
                My suitcase got stolen on the way but luckily the expensive stuff was in my backpack.
                Still something of a bummer.

            <h2><time>2022 and earlier</time></h2>
            <p>
                This is my first entry, fun!
                Up until this point, I've only had thoughts of congregating my ideas and what I do.
                I guess this is it.
                First and foremost, I would like to thank Dave Gauer at <a href="http://ratfactor.com">ratfactor.com</a> for inspiring me to do this.
                I read about his <a href="https://ratfactor.com/notes">notebook system</a> and really liked it.
            </p>
            <p>
                What have I been doing up until now?
                Not a whole lot really, I'm still young!
                In short, I spent an unhealthy amount of time on my computer.
                Inevitably, I became pretty knowledgeable with it.
                I've dabbled in small bits of programming since I was 14.
                Started getting interested in it as I was 13.
                First code I wrote was HTML, naturally it led onto JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've used Discord for a while now but before that, there was a platform made by Curse that I used to chat on.
                Minecraft has been a game I've always liked so I used to talk in some Minecraft forum server.
                On there I met my longest-standing online contact, who I've now known for 6 years and counting.
                Unfortunately the Curse app was bought by Twitch and all the accounts got migrated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the time I was 15 we got to do some programming in school.
                It was really just Scratch but it's neat that we got to do it.
                My maths teacher even told me he thought I'd be a programmer in the future.
                I didn't think much of it at the time but, turned out true!
            </p>
            <p>
                From there on I picked up NodeJS and Python.
                When I was around 16~17, we had a teacher who was into web development.
                We got to learn some Dreamweaver in school and we used a server he rented.
                It ran PHP so I got in touch with some of that as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                During that time, my father gave me two servers.
                Both of them were from his workplace, both of them supposed to be scrapped.
                That was my introduction to Linux.
                I'm really glad I got to experiment with it.
                Nowadays I'm a bit of a Linux/libre software geek.
                Not that I'm super-duper technical with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where am I now?
                Well, I got a job recently-ish (4 months ago) and moved out in conjunction with it, my first time living on my own.
                It's peculiar but I feel safe and I think that's what matters most.
                I graduated from "gymnasium" in the summer, I was 18 turning 19 at the time for reference.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel lucky to be where I am at the moment.
                The school I went to had a collaboration with Special-Elektronik, a distributor of AV equipment in Sweden and a certified Crestron dealer.
                In school we had a couple months of time dedicated to internship and getting work experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my internship, I happened to be one of the few who were interested in going to Special-Elektronik.
                They accepted people from my school and the school right next to ours.
                At Special-Elektronik, we got to enjoy a couple Crestron courses, rounding up with a certificate in CTI-P101, the "beginner programmer" course so-to-speak.
                Nonetheless, it meant I had some dirt on my hands, and I wasn't too shabby at it either.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Special-Elektronik is a certified dealer, they had some people from a small company on a visit for business.
                It's a service company, they work with AV/IT integration and procurements.
                I don't know if they were coming there with this trainee programme in mind, but they happened to be short on staff.
                There was a small little interview to get to know us and, well, now I'm in Stockholm.
