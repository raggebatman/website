            <p>
                It's Christmas Eve so I just felt like writing something a little short.
                Yeah, we celebrate on the eve in Sweden.
                Writing this at my parents' house which is where I used to live a mere couple months ago.
                Happy holidays, reader.
                My suitcase got stolen on the way but luckily the expensive stuff was in my backpack.
                Still something of a bummer.

                This is my first entry, fun!
                Up until this point, I've only had thoughts of congregating my ideas and what I do.
                I guess this is it.
