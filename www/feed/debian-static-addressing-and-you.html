                Something I found out recently is that the DHCP client
                doesn't get configured correctly on Debian if you edit
                the /etc/network/interfaces file to set a static address
                before bringing the interface down.
            </p>
            <p>
                What happens instead is that you set a static address...
                and then the interface gets reconfigured with a dynamic
                address after a while. You actually need to bring the
                interface down (using ifdown) while the file is configured
                for DHCP addressing in order for the DHCP client to be
                disabled.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you're setting a static address, don't be like
                me and instead remember to bring the interface down before
                configuring it :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, the wiki page simply states to "disable
                all DHCP services" when you're setting a static address
                which admittedly is all well and true which I forgot to
                do- but never is there a mention that this is done for
                you if you do it this way! As long as you're using the
                DHCP client provided by the installer of course.
