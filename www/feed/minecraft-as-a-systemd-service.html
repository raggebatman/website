            <p>
                Yesterday on a Sunday, I had the bright idea of spending my
                afternoon tinkering with setting up a Minecraft beta server
                that I've today realised I won't ever play on. I did learn about
                services and sockets a bit more though which is what I'll write
                about hereafter. So far it's nothing more but a hacked together
                set of files based on various Internet searches, but it's a
                stepping stone towards sharpening my Linux skills (that's
                what I like to think at least.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Alright, firstly, when setting up the server I thought "hey,
                I've seen Valheim done using systemd before so why not Minecraft?"
                I got right to it, looked around here and there... Seemed like
                a not-so-difficult thing to do. However, the guide that I was
                following assumed that Minecraft came with RCON implemented which
                is their remote control protocol thingamabob. As I was
                setting up a beta server, that was not the case. Which led me into
                systemd sockets. Why? Because it looked like you could send
                stdin to the process of the systemd service, i.e. home-made RCON.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unexplored territory! For me, at least. I had never touched a socket
                file before aside from starting/enabling a few. I'll actually show
                the file contents below for you to inspect.

            <h2>The service file</h2>
            <div class="codeblock">
                <span>/etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service</span>
                <code>
                    <pre>[Unit]

                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                Note the "exec" statement in ExecStart. I haven't actually looked
                into why this works, but it does and that was enough for me
                at the time. Notably in the service file is that the KillSignal
                is SIGCONT instead of SIGKILL. This means that stopping the service
                won't actually kill it initially, but it will kill it if it hasn't
                stopped after some time (30 seconds if I'm not mistaken.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest is fairly self-explanatory. Observe how "stop" is redirected
                to a file in the ExecStop line. That's elaborated on in the socket file.
                For context, minecraft is a user whose home directory is set to
                /opt/minecraft. Also note the Sockets line specifying our socket
                file, minecraft.socket. Specifying this will set up all the
                dependencies for us.
            </p>
            <h2>The socket file</h2>
            <div class="codeblock">
                <span>/etc/systemd/system/minecraft.socket</span>
                <code>
                    <pre>[Unit]
Description=Minecraft Socket
AssertPathExists=/run
BindsTo=minecraft.service
[Socket]
ListenFIFO=/run/minecraft.control
FileDescriptorName=control
RemoveOnStop=true
SocketMode=0660
SocketUser=minecraft
SocketGroup=minecraft
[Install]

                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                The important parts here are the ListenFIFO line, BindsTo,
                and RemoveOnStop. FIFO was a new concept to me as of yesterday;
                it's basically a pipe in the form of a file descriptor. You can
                redirect stdout into this path and the systemd socket will receive it.
                Pretty neat, and pretty simple. You also have the option to choose
                ListenDatagram for UDP-like communication and you can even expose
                this socket to IP making it networked if you want. There are
                definitely some interesting opportunities regarding that.
            </p>
            <p>
                See also here how the user and group belong to minecraft. This
                account doesn't have a password on my system so the only way
                to access it is to sudo su. I'm not really sure of the security
                implications regarding this implementation, I'll have to look
                at that more in-depth.
            </p>
            <h2>The startup script</h2>
            <div class="codeblock">
                <span>/opt/minecraft/server/run.sh</span>
                <code>
                    <pre>#!/bin/sh

java -Xms512M -Xmx4G -jar server.jar nogui</pre>
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                This just invokes java, but, I thought I'd show it.
            </p>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
                The nice part here is managing the Minecraft server like any other
                systemd service. You can run <code>systemctl enable minecraft</code>,
                disable it, start/stop it, and it works like a charm. All made
                possible by the socket which makes us able to send commands to it
                using scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, as long as you're using the minecraft account, you can
                send commands to the server wherever you are! I used this to
                set up automatic backups of the server, forcing a save of all
                chunks and packing it into a tar archive- accomplished with cron of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's all for now, a simple demonstration of what I discovered.
                I'll definitely have a closer look at sockets in systemd in the future,
                they look really interesting! Notably, I want to see how to receive
                feedback from the socket (stdout) and process it using a programming
                language of some sort.
