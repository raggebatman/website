        <main>
            <p>
                This will be my meagre attempt at retelling
                the unassuming forthcoming of my website.
                Let's get started with where it is as of
                writing this (Nov. 2023).
            </p>
            <h2>The current</h2>
            <p>
                I host my website statically with everything
                being hand-written. This is accomplished through
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" rel="external">GitHub</a> and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercel" rel="external">Vercel</a>;
                the latter being what serves
                the content to you and the former being what
                is actually hosting the content.
                Doesn't get a whole lot cheaper than that combo, huh?
                The domain registrar is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecheap" rel="external">Namecheap</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>The past</h2>
            <p>
                This place has gone through a fair few iterations.
                If I remember this correctly, it started back in 2017
                with my website being hosted thru GitHub Pages.
                It was naught for more than shitposting purposes.
                It must have remained that way up until about 2020-21
                when I started looking into
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linode" rel="external">Linode</a>.
                In 2022-23 was when things really took off in my so-called
                "exploratory phase" as I so creatively dubbed it in this moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had ideas upon ideas of things to do on my website
                and different back-ends, ways to host it, templating,
                content management, and so on. As mentioned, I looked
                into Linode to start off with and how to host my website
                from there. I actually set up a machine with PHP and
                wrote my website using that to start off. Then it shifted
                over to Ruby as I started getting into that. I attempted
                to write my own "templating engine" with ERB, then
                I looked at Rails and Sinatra, but nothing really came
                from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had decided that I wanted a way to write my content
                and fuhgeddaboudit. Logically this meant separating the
                content from "the rest."
                This was what I had attempted to do previously using Ruby, but
                it was way too much of a time sink for me to bother and I
                didn't really like the frameworks that exist for it.
                So what did I do? I jumped on the <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> train!
                (Is that a thing?)
            </p>
            <p>
                This was where I delved into Vercel to deploy my code
                rather than performing everything from a machine as that
                for me involved an SSH session and editing files directly
                which felt a little... primitive. I quite enjoy the Git workflow.
                Anyhoo, the first SSG that I used was (you got it) Jekyll!
                Then there was SvelteKit, Middleman, Nanoc, Fresh, Bridgetown and
                one more that I can't remember. I had also tried out hosting
                my website using MediaWiki and DokuWiki. Eventually I landed
                on writing the code by hand because (pardon my French) I had
                enough of that shit.
            </p>
            <h2>The why</h2>
            <p>
                I cannot understate the liberating feeling of typing HTML yourself.
                Furthermore, I cannot really explain it. It is just quite pleasant
                to type what you think, not having to think about the implementation.
                I also believe that it gives a special charm to a website when
                other people commit to the same feat. The downside to this static
                approach is that I can't easily implement something like a guestbook
                but, honestly, as much of a fun thing it is- it's not necessary.
                Oh, can't not mention this, writing HTML yourself means you get
                total control of what gets delivered to the user. No minimised
                HTML or weird structures!
                I have to be able to read it in code so why shouldn't you?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, hacking code together on your own is tedious and is not really
                in any way superior to alternatives that exist out there. But it is
                a fun little thing that I like taking time out of my day to do.
